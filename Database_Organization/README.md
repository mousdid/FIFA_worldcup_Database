Our project is about the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup Database

It is meant for a typical end user curious about the database. Along with slightly advanced users that can enter their own SQL Queries. 

The folder Source_Code contains all the python files for the UI.

<h3>Necessary Libraries</h3>
The libraries that are needed are mysql.connector, pandas, and tkinter.

If you are having trouble conencting, make sure you install mysql-connector-python specifically. 

<h3>Warnings</h3>

We had trouble running the app perfectly on a MacOS machine compared to windows. 

<h3>Database Setup</h3>

The program will prompt all necessary information (host, user, pw) to connect to your MySQL. 
These options can be set as the default settings by changing the values 'default_host', 'default_user', and 'default_password' in the main.py file on lines 18-20. 

Additionally, the program will prompt the user to create a new database 'cs425_fifa_fa24'. 

This is done by executing the commands in a .sql file called 'cs425_fifa_fa24_db_setup.sql'. 

<h3>Running the Program</h3>
Run the main.py file and the program should start.

We hope you enjoy!
